# monolith

This is a role for combining multiple roles into a single role for installing and configuring a monolithic application on a target machine.
This role combines the following roles:

- `nova.core.caddy`
- `nova.core.vault`
- `nova.core.keycloak`
- `nova.core.providentia`
- `nova.core.nexus`

It's meant for easy deployment of all required services for running a Cyber Exercise. The role generates and writes it's application default credentials into Vault. The login token for the Vault can be found at `/srv/vault/creds/root_token`.

## Requirements

- Pre existing/installed and configured Active Directory (AD) server for LDAPs.
- Pre installed Debian based OS (Ubuntu 22.04 preferred) with SSH & sudo access where the application will be installed if not pre-existing infrastructure is present.
- TLS certificate for all services under the `/srv/certs/{{ fqdn }}_fullchain.crt` must be pre-installed. Alternatively, the `nova.core.caddy` role will generate self-signed certificates.
- The DNS names defined in `monolith_*` variables must be resolvable from the host where this role is executed from.

## Role Variables

These variables need to be defined in the host_var or passed from command line in order to connect and configure the previously cloned host where the monolith will be installed.

```yaml
infra_env: external # This says that the host where monolith is manually set up and not cloned by nova.core.machine_operations rol
save_secrets_to_vault: false # By default  not saving secrets to vault because we're setting it up in this run

# This is list of internal CA certificates will trusted by the monolith services for an example for LDAPS.
# Remove this list if globally trusted CA certificates are used also for LDAPs.
trusted_certificates_list:
  - name: LDAPS
    src: "{{ inventory_dir }}/files/LDAPS.crt"

connection_address: 10.10.10.10 # This is the IP address of the host where monolith will be installed
ansible_deployer_username: # This is the username that will be used to connect to the host
ansible_deployer_password: # This is the password that will be used to connect to the host
hostname: # This is the hostname that will be set for the host
domain: # This is the domain that will be set for the host
ad_domain_name: "{{ domain }}"
fqdn: "{{ hostname }}.{{ domain }}"
```

Although there are some variables available to this role, it recommended to only set values for variables defined in the example below. This is a kickstart role and should be used as such. Advanced users can install the individual roles separately for more control.

`-e monolith_single_service=service_name` can be appended to command line to only configure single service after the initial setup.

## Dependencies
